### Updates

Check for Dokploy updates and apply them as needed. When you check for updates, a modal will open with an action button to check for updates. If a new version is available, the button will indicate it is loading. After a few seconds, it will display the new version and provide an option to update.



#### Considerations

- The update process usually takes between 20 seconds and 1 minute to complete.
- All your services and domains will remain operational during the update, so it is safe to apply an update.
- We are not responsible for any downtime caused by the update process.
- We recommend updating if you are experiencing a bug or want to access new features.
- It is important to read the release notes before updating to avoid any unexpected issues.
