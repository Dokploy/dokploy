Dokploy offers several deployment methods, streamlining the process whether you're utilizing GitHub, any Git provider, Docker, or automated deployments.

- GitHub
- Git (Any Git Provider)
- Docker

## GitHub

Deploying via GitHub is straightforward:

1. Configure your GitHub repository in the `/dashboard/settings/server`.
2. When creating an application, Dokploy automatically retrieves the available repositories and branches.

## Git

For deployments from any Git repository, whether public or private, you can use either SSH or HTTPS:

1. Enter the repository URL.
2. Specify the branch you wish to deploy.

### Private Repositories

For private repositories, authenticate using SSH. We provide a lock icon to generate an SSH key.

You can then copy the SSH key and paste it into the settings of your account.

This enables you to pull repositories from your private repository, a method consistent across nearly all providers.

## Docker

For Docker deployments:

- Provide a Docker image. For private repositories, enter the username and password.
