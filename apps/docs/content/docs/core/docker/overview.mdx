Dokploy leverages Docker Swarm to orchestrate and manage container deployments for your applications, providing an intuitive interface for monitoring and control.

## Viewing Containers

To monitor and manage the containers running on your server:

- Navigate to the `/dashboard/docker` route in Dokploy.
- This page displays all the containers currently active on your server.

## Container Actions

For each container, you have several management options:

- **View Logs**: Access real-time logs from the container to monitor its activity and troubleshoot issues.
- **View Config**: Review the configuration settings of the container to understand its deployment parameters.
- **Terminal**: Open a terminal session directly within the container for advanced management tasks.

These features provide comprehensive tools to manage your applications' containers effectively, all from within Dokployâ€™s user-friendly dashboard.
