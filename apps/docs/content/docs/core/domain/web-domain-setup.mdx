This guide covers the basic setup of a main domain for your Dokploy panel.

## DNS Setup

We'll use [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) for DNS management, but you can use any provider. The steps should be similar.

1. Log in to Cloudflare and navigate to `Websites` -> `Your Domain` -> `DNS` -> `Records`.
2. Click on `Add record`, select `A`.
3. Enter `canary` in the name field and your IP address (e.g., `1.2.3.4`) in the value field.
4. Save the record. Your DNS record will be `canary.dokploy.com`.

## Dokploy Panel Setup

1. Log in to your Dokploy panel.
2. Navigate to `/dashboard/settings/server`.
3. Under Server domain, set your domain to match the one configured in Cloudflare (e.g., `canary.dokploy.com`).
4. Choose your certificate option:
   - `None`
   - `Let's Encrypt`
6. Access your panel via `https://canary.dokploy.com`.


For detailed instructions on setting up certificates, refer to the [Certificates](/docs/core/domain/certificates) documentation.
