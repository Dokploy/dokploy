This guide details how to set up a domain for your application.

## Create DNS Record

1. Add an `A` record to your DNS settings:
   - **Name:** Enter the route you want to point to (e.g., `app` for `app.yourdomain.com`).
   - **Value:** Type in the IP address of your server, such as `1.2.3.4`.

## Application Domain Setup

1. Navigate to your application's dashboard.
2. Go to the `Domains` tab and click on `Add Domain`.
3. Enter the DNS record you created in the previous step (e.g., `app.yourdomain.com`).
4. Make sure to assign the right container port (e.g., NextJS: `3000`).
5. Choose your certificate option:
   - `None`
   - `Let's Encrypt`
   

For detailed instructions on setting up certificates, refer to the [Certificates](/docs/core/domain/certificates) documentation.
