This guide will give you an idea of the requirements to assign a domain to your Dokploy panel or use it in any other application, whether Docker Compose or otherwise.

## Requirements

Before beginning, ensure you have a domain purchased from one of the following providers or a provider of your choice:

- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)
- [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/)
- [Name.com](https://www.name.com/)
- [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com/)
- [Domain.com](https://www.domain.com/)


## Transfer Setup(Optional)

We recommend transferring your domain to Cloudflare for free SSL certificates and flexibility in using tools:
