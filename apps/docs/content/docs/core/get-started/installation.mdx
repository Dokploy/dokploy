### Docker

Dokploy utilizes Docker, so it is essential to have Docker installed on your server. If Docker is not already installed, use the following command to install it automatically:

```bash
curl -sSL https://dokploy.com/install.sh | sh
```

## Completing the Setup

After running the installation script, Dokploy and its dependencies will be set up on your server. Here's how to finalize the setup and start using Dokploy:

### Accessing Dokploy
