---

If you wish to customize the Dokploy installation on your server, you can modify several aspects:

1. **Use a specific port for Dokploy** - Ideal for avoiding conflicts with other services.
2. **Select a specific version of Dokploy** - Choose between versions like canary, latest, or a specific Docker tag (e.g., v0.0.1).
3. **Specify HTTP and HTTPS ports for Traefik** - Useful when running alongside other servers like Nginx.

## Installation Script

Here is a Bash script for installing Dokploy on a Linux server. Make sure you run this as root on a Linux environment that is not a container, and ensure ports 80 and 443 are free.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Ensure the script is run as root
if [ "$(id -u)" != "0" ]; then
    echo "This script must be run as root" >&2
    exit 1
fi

# Check for Linux OS (not macOS or inside a Docker container)
if [ "$(uname)" = "Darwin" ]; then
    echo "This script must be run on Linux" >&2
    exit 1
fi

if [ -f /.dockerenv ]; then
    echo "This script must be run on a native Linux host" >&2
    exit 1
fi

# Check for occupied ports
if ss -tulnp | grep ':80 ' >/dev/null; then
    echo "Error: Port 80 is already in use" >&2
    exit 1
fi

if ss -tulnp | grep ':443 ' >/dev/null; then
    echo "Error: Port 443 is already in use" >&2
    exit 1
fi

# Function to check if a command exists
command_exists() {
  command -v "$@" > /dev/null 2>&1
}

# Install Docker if it is not installed
if command_exists docker; then
  echo "Docker already installed"
else
  curl -sSL https://get.docker.com | sh
fi

# Initialize Docker Swarm
docker swarm leave --force 2>/dev/null
advertise_addr=$(curl -s ifconfig.me)
docker swarm init --advertise-addr $advertise_addr
echo "Swarm initialized"

# Create network
docker network rm -f dokploy-network 2>/dev/null
docker network create --driver overlay --attachable dokploy-network
echo "Network created"

# Prepare configuration directory
mkdir -p /etc/dokploy
chmod -R 777 /etc/dokploy

# Pull and deploy Dokploy
docker pull dokploy/dokploy:latest
docker service create \
  --name dokploy \
  --replicas 1 \
  --network dokploy-network \
  --mount type=bind,source=/var/run/docker.sock,target=/var/run/docker.sock \
  --mount type=bind,source=/etc/dokploy,target=/etc/dokploy \
  --publish published=3000,target=3000,mode=host \
  --update-parallelism 1 \
  --update-order stop-first \
  -e PORT=<Value For PORT eg(3000)> \
  -e TRAEFIK_SSL_PORT=<Value For SSL PORT eg(444)> \
  -e TRAEFIK_PORT=<VALUE FOR TRAEFIK HTTP PORT eg(81)> \
  dokploy/dokploy:latest

# Output success message
GREEN="\033[0;32m"
YELLOW="\033[1;33m"
BLUE="\033[0;34m"
NC="\033[0m" # No Color
printf "${GREEN}Congratulations, Dokploy is installed!${NC}\n"
printf "${BLUE}Wait 15 seconds for the server to start${NC}\n"
printf "${YELLOW}Please go to http://${advertise_addr}:3000${NC}\n\n"

```


This script includes checks for common pitfalls, installs Docker if itâ€™s not already installed, initializes a Docker Swarm, creates a network, and then pulls and deploys Dokploy. After the script runs, it provides a success message and instructions for accessing Dokploy.

This structured format clearly lays out the prerequisites, steps, and post-installation information, making it user-friendly and accessible for those performing manual installations.

## Customize install 
#### Customize swarm advertise address

The --advertise-addr parameter in the docker swarm init command specifies the IP address or interface that the Docker Swarm manager node should advertise to other nodes in the Swarm. This address is used by other nodes to communicate with the manager.

By default, this script uses the external IP address of the server, obtained using the `curl -s ifconfig.me` command. However, you might need to customize this address based on your network configuration, especially if your server has multiple network interfaces or if you're setting up Swarm in a private network.

To customize the --advertise-addr parameter, replace the line: `advertise_addr=$(curl -s ifconfig.me)` with your desired IP address or interface, for example:
`advertise_addr="192.168.1.100"`

:warning: This IP address should be accessible to all nodes that will join the Swarm.


## Existing Docker swarm

If you already have a Docker swarm running on your server and you want to use dokploy, you can use the following command to join it:


```bash
docker network create --driver overlay --attachable dokploy-network

mkdir -p /etc/dokploy

chmod -R 777 /etc/dokploy

docker pull dokploy/dokploy:latest

# Installation
docker service create \
  --name dokploy \
  --replicas 1 \
  --network dokploy-network \
  --mount type=bind,source=/var/run/docker.sock,target=/var/run/docker.sock \
  --mount type=bind,source=/etc/dokploy,target=/etc/dokploy \
  --publish published=3000,target=3000,mode=host \
  --update-parallelism 1 \
  --update-order stop-first \
  dokploy/dokploy:latest
```
