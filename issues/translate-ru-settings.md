## Context
- Task: Translate remaining English strings in `apps/dokploy/public/locales/ru/settings.json` to Russian, keeping placeholders (`{{...}}`) and variables intact; only change values, not keys.

## Plan
- Scan the settings locale file to locate English or partially untranslated values.
- Translate those values into natural Russian while preserving placeholders and formatting.
- Leave already-correct Russian entries untouched and validate JSON structure after edits.
