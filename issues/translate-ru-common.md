## Context
- Task: Translate remaining English strings in `apps/dokploy/public/locales/ru/common.json` to Russian, keeping placeholders like `{{name}}` and `{0}` intact and leaving keys unchanged.

## Plan
- Scan the JSON for English or partially untranslated values.
- Translate those values into natural Russian while preserving placeholders and formatting.
- Keep existing Russian translations untouched and validate JSON structure.
