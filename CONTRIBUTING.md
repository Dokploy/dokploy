## Setup

Before you start, please make the clone based on the `canary` branch, since the `main` branch is the source of truth and should always reflect the latest stable release, also the PRs will be merged to the `canary` branch.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dokploy/dokploy.git
cd dokploy
pnpm install
cp apps/dokploy/.env.example apps/dokploy/.env
```

## Development

Is required to have **Docker** installed on your machine.

### Setup

Run the command that will spin up all the required services and files.

```bash
pnpm run dokploy:setup
```

Now run the development server.

```bash
pnpm run dokploy:dev
```

Go to http://localhost:3000 to see the development server

## Build

```bash
pnpm run dokploy:build
```

## Docker

To build the docker image

```bash
pnpm run docker:build
```

To push the docker image

```bash
pnpm run docker:push
```

## Password Reset

In the case you lost your password, you can reset it using the following command

```bash
pnpm run reset-password
```

If you want to test the webhooks on development mode using localtunnel, make sure to install `localtunnel`

```bash
bunx lt --port 3000
```

If you run into permission issues of docker run the following command

```bash
sudo chown -R USERNAME dokploy or sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.docker
```

## Application deploy

In case you want to deploy the application on your machine and you selected nixpacks or buildpacks, you need to install first.

```bash
# Install Nixpacks
curl -sSL https://nixpacks.com/install.sh -o install.sh \
    && chmod +x install.sh \
    && ./install.sh
```

```bash
# Install Buildpacks
curl -sSL "https://github.com/buildpacks/pack/releases/download/v0.32.1/pack-v0.32.1-linux.tgz" | tar -C /usr/local/bin/ --no-same-owner -xzv pack
```

## Pull Request

- The `main` branch is the source of truth and should always reflect the latest stable release.
- Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix.
- Make sure to add tests for your changes.
- Make sure to update the documentation for any changes Go to the [docs.dokploy.com](https://docs.dokploy.com) website to see the changes.
- When creating a pull request, please provide a clear and concise description of the changes made.
- If you include a video or screenshot, would be awesome so we can see the changes in action.
- If your pull request fixes an open issue, please reference the issue in the pull request description.
- Once your pull request is merged, you will be automatically added as a contributor to the project.

Thank you for your contribution!

## Templates

To add a new template, go to `templates` folder and create a new folder with the name of the template.

Let's take the example of `plausible` template.

1. create a folder in `templates/plausible`
2. create a `docker-compose.yml` file inside the folder with the content of compose.
3. create a `index.ts` file inside the folder with the following code as base:
4. When creating a pull request, please provide a video of the template working in action.

```typescript
// EXAMPLE
import {
  generateHash,
  generateRandomDomain,
  type Template,
  type Schema,
} from "../utils";

export function generate(schema: Schema): Template {
  // do your stuff here, like create a new domain, generate random passwords, mounts.
  const mainServiceHash = generateHash(schema.projectName);
  const randomDomain = generateRandomDomain(schema);
  const secretBase = generateBase64(64);
  const toptKeyBase = generateBase64(32);

  const envs = [
    // If you want to show a domain in the UI, please add the prefix _HOST at the end of the variable name.
    `PLAUSIBLE_HOST=${randomDomain}`,
    "PLAUSIBLE_PORT=8000",
    `BASE_URL=http://${randomDomain}`,
    `SECRET_KEY_BASE=${secretBase}`,
    `TOTP_VAULT_KEY=${toptKeyBase}`,
    `HASH=${mainServiceHash}`,
  ];

  const mounts: Template["mounts"] = [
    {
      mountPath: "./clickhouse/clickhouse-config.xml",
      content: `some content......`,
    },
  ];

  return {
    envs,
    mounts,
  };
}
```

4. Now you need to add the information about the template to the `templates/templates.ts` is a object with the following properties:

**Make sure the id of the template is the same as the folder name and don't have any spaces, only slugified names and lowercase.**

```typescript
{
	id: "plausible",
	name: "Plausible",
	version: "v2.1.0",
	description:
		"Plausible is a open source, self-hosted web analytics platform that lets you track website traffic and user behavior.",
	logo: "plausible.svg", // we defined the name and the extension of the logo
	links: {
		github: "https://github.com/plausible/plausible",
		website: "https://plausible.io/",
		docs: "https://plausible.io/docs",
	},
	tags: ["analytics"],
	load: () => import("./plausible/index").then((m) => m.generate),
},
```

5. Add the logo or image of the template to `public/templates/plausible.svg`

### Recomendations

- Use the same name of the folder as the id of the template.
- The logo should be in the public folder.
- If you want to show a domain in the UI, please add the prefix \_HOST at the end of the variable name.
- Test first on a vps or a server to make sure the template works.
