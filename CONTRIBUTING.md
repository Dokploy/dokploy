## Setup

Before you start, please make the clone based on the `canary` branch, since the `main` branch is the source of truth and should always reflect the latest stable release, also the PRs will be merged to the `canary` branch.

We use Node v20.9.0

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dokploy/dokploy.git
cd dokploy
pnpm install
cp apps/dokploy/.env.example apps/dokploy/.env
```

## Development

Is required to have **Docker** installed on your machine.

### Setup

Run the command that will spin up all the required services and files.

```bash
pnpm run dokploy:setup
```

Run this script

```bash
pnpm run server:script
```

Now run the development server.

```bash
pnpm run dokploy:dev
```

Go to http://localhost:3000 to see the development server

## Build

```bash
pnpm run dokploy:build
```

## Docker

To build the docker image

```bash
pnpm run docker:build
```

To push the docker image

```bash
pnpm run docker:push
```

## Password Reset

In the case you lost your password, you can reset it using the following command

```bash
pnpm run reset-password
```

If you want to test the webhooks on development mode using localtunnel, make sure to install `localtunnel`

```bash
bunx lt --port 3000
```

If you run into permission issues of docker run the following command

```bash
sudo chown -R USERNAME dokploy or sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.docker
```

## Application deploy

In case you want to deploy the application on your machine and you selected nixpacks or buildpacks, you need to install first.

```bash
# Install Nixpacks
curl -sSL https://nixpacks.com/install.sh -o install.sh \
    && chmod +x install.sh \
    && ./install.sh
```

```bash
# Install Railpack
curl -sSL https://railpack.com/install.sh | sh
```

```bash
# Install Buildpacks
curl -sSL "https://github.com/buildpacks/pack/releases/download/v0.32.1/pack-v0.32.1-linux.tgz" | tar -C /usr/local/bin/ --no-same-owner -xzv pack
```

### Recommendations

- Use the same name of the folder as the id of the template.
- The logo should be in the public folder.
- If you want to show a domain in the UI, please add the `_HOST` suffix at the end of the variable name.
